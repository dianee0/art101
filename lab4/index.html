			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab is to understand the importance of pseudocode is as opposed to coding afterwards. 
						Psuedocode allows you to have an outline of your code.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that occured was picking a recipe that was overly complicated which made us realize we shouldn't have overcomplicated the recipe we chose.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						This assignment went well and I felt like we were able to use our time efficiently in order to complete this lab. We undoubtedly put a good amount effort towards the lab
						and researched on subjects we were not too familar with. 
					</p>

						<h3>Task 1: Psuedocode Everyday Task</h3>
						<p>We used ChatGTP for this Recipe.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Gather the ingredients:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Flour</li>
								<li>Eggs</li>
								<li>Salt</li>
								<li>Water (if needed)</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
							<li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.</li>
							<li>Crack the eggs into the well.</li>
							<li>Use a fork to gently beat the eggs and gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
							<li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
							<li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
							<li>Once the dough has rested, roll it out with a rolling pin or pasta machine to the desired thickness.</li>
							<li>Cut the dough into the desired shape (such as spaghetti or fettuccine).</li>
							<li>Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water for 2-4 minutes (depending on the thickness of the pasta).</li>
							<li>Drain the pasta and serve with your favorite sauce or toppings.</li>
							<li>Enjoy your homemade pasta!</li>

						<h3>Task 3: Turn pseudocode into comments</h3>
						<pre>
//Print images of 'rock' 'paper' and 'scissors' on the screen.
//Print a timer for each player (10 seconds).
//Timer starts counting down from 10 seconds:
	//while seconds is greater than 0
		//print the value in seconds
		//subtract 1 from seconds
//Accept user input from both ends.
//If no user input is obtained from both players
	//The game restarts.
//When the timer reaches 0
	//Print both user inputs on screen.
//Print the winner's username.
