			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of the assignment is to familarize ourselves with functions in javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems we encountered was the window.prompt() kept popping up twice. We were able to fix this by keeping this outside of the functions. Additionally,
                        when doing the bonus task, we encountered an issue of capitalizing every first letter of the new anagram name if there are spaces. We were able to get the first letter
                        capitalized though.
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this assignment was not too bad, and I felt like this assignment was slightly more difficult than our previous labs considering we did the bonus task.</p>
