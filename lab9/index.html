					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some issues that arose was when christina and I had an issue with a bit of CSS code. The webpage color was cutting off, and in order to fix this, we had to set the minimum height to 100%.
						Since we spent a good protion figuring out how to style our webpage (in rainbow), we did not have enough time to work on the bonus task.
