						Christina and I didn't have many issues with the intial task; we had a bit of trouble with the bonus tasks. We decided we wanted to
						challenge ourselves by creating a button that changed an aspect of the webpage. We had another button where when you clicked it,
						it would make an image pop up. Additonally, we decided to style our button with CSS so it would look nicer and it even had a hover feature.
						We had a bit of an issue with the buttons and the image popup, but with the help of chatGPT, we were able to find the problem with our 
						image popup and why it was not working. Additionally, we made sure that once the button was pressed once,
						it would disable the button and when you clicked anywhere else the image would disappear and the button would be enabled again.
