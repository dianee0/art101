					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						Christina and I encountered some issues with jQuerey because we would misspell some of our class names when we referenced them.
						Additionally, we struggled a bit with the bonus task because we encountered issues where the button would not change colors. However,
						to fix this, we would need to use an if and else statement to check the conditionals for if the button was the orginal color versus not being the orginal color.
