			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Purpose</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab is to create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>One of the challenges of the lab would be the remote meetup, it made it a bit difficult to work with one another, 
						but we managed to work with one another through discord. Additionally, Bianca and I had an issue with the lab links to redirect them to our other html website. However, this was solved by adding "../lab".</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						The assignment went well, however I felt as if I didn't have enough time to put more effort into my website. Due to late enrollment, I felt like I was bit contrained on time and
						could not work on this project till later on in the night the day before the due date. I would've liked to add more into the .css aspect of the assignment.
