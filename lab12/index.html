						Christina and I had a bit of an issue with the bonus task but we managed to resolve our issue. We realized that we had called a variable that was defined in another function.
						When doing this, it completely messed up our description, but we realized what we had done, and fixed it. Additionally, we had some minor issues with misspelling variables names.
