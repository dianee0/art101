					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						Christina and I had trouble with the instructions a bit because the code shown in the pictures did not match the instructions. Additionally, we had trouble with the columns because for some reason they were not outputting into three columns. However, we fixed this after I realized I had been working in the wrong CSS file. We also had an issue when pressing the start button multiple times. When pressing it multiple times, it would repeat the code, to fix this we disabled the button when you click it once.
